## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.** -->

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge really thought me how to style and work with range inputs. Apparently it's not as straight-forward as I thought, especially when you consider browser compatibility. I got to understand some subtle differences in how browsers render webpages.
This was fun to work on! ðŸ™‚

### Continued development

I'm going to be more intentional about testing on multiple browsers than I used to. This project really taught me that one size doesn't always fit all.

### Useful resources

- [Smashing Magazine | Creating A Custom Range Input That Looks Consistent Across All Browsers](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/12/create-custom-range-input-consistent-browsers/) - This blog post helped me understand how the range input behaves accross browsers and how to style it to be consistent across. Very helpful.
- [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1461023/15128288) - This answer to [@tgandrews' question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1461015/why-dont-ul-bullets-stay-within-their-containing-div) on Stack overflow provides an easy fix to make `li` bullets stay within it's parent container.
